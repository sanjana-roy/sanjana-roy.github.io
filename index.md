# GEOG 323: OpenSource GIScience | [Course Website](https://gis4dev.github.io)

Hi, my name is Sanjana and I'm an Architecture and Environmental Studies joint major and Biology minor at Middlebury College. As someone interested in how urban and natural environments correlate, I find GIS to be a very useful skill to develop. This website is a documentation of the projects I have done under the OpenSource GIScience course, and reflections on the material we are working with as well as wider questions in the open-source and GIS fields.
