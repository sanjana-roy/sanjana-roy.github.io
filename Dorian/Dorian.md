## Abstract

Wang et al. (2016) analyzed Twitter data for wildfires in California, finding that the social media data are useful in framing the spatial and temporal extents of wildfire events, providing useful information on disaster situations. The study found that social media data are able to track real-time hotspots and risks posed by wildfire events and that news and local media authorities play a large role in the retweet network in influencing the distribution of information, providing implications for emergency response and management as well as public situational awareness. Holler (2021) is studying Twitter data for Hurricane Dorian on the Atlantic coast, finding that in spite of tending news and social media content regarding a false narrative of risk, original Tweets still clustered significantly along the real hurricane track, and only along the hurricane track.

Reproducing and replicating spatial research of Twitter data during natural disasters continues to be relevant because it unearths patterns of human communication that respond differently to different disaster scenarios. Due to the nature of online data constantly being deleted or modified, it is difficult to conduct replication studies that prove previous results. However, reproduction studies using different data and applied to different scenarios allows us to observe these patterns. The role of social media during disasters is constantly evolving and is important to study due to the influence it has in communication during difficult times and people's reliance on the information it disseminates.

In his replication study, I will analyse the spatial distribution of tweets during the tornado occurring from April 28, 2021 to May 5, 2021 in the Southern states of the USA, and specifically in Mississippi.


## Original Study Information

Holler (2021) loosely replicated the methods of Wang et al (2016) for the case of Hurricane Dorian's landfall on the U.S. mainland during the 2019 Atlantic Hurricane season. Wang et al.'s (2016) data was based on Twitter Search API queries for 'fire' and 'wildfire' and then further focused on the specific wildfires in 'Bernado' and 'San Marcos' during the time period of May 13, 2014 to May 22, 2014. The geographical extent of this twitter data was set at a radius of 40 miles from San Diego County. The authors conducted an analysis identifying important terms and term clusters, using k-means method of clustering, and found that the majority of tweets focused on the need to evacuate or the current state of fires and extent of damage caused in homes. A social network analysis was also conducted based on retweet relationships identified in the data, finding that local news media have a large impact on the social media network and the distribution of information. Lastly, the authors also used dual kernel density estimation (Dual KDE), in conjuntion with census population data at the block level, to map the spatial patterns of tweets associated with the two specific wildfires in Bernado and San Marcos and found that tweet locations largely corresponded with the locations of wildfires.

Holler modified Wang et al's methods by not searching for retweets for network analysis, focusing instead on original Tweet content with keywords hurricane, Dorian, or sharpiegate (a trending hashtag referring to the storm). Holler modified the methodology for normalizing tweet data by creating a normalized Tweet difference index and extended the methodology to test for spatial clustering with the local Getis-Ord statistic. The study tested a hypothesis that false narratives of hurricane risk promulgated at the highest levels of the United States government would significantly distort the geographic distribution of Twitter activity related to the hurricane and its impacts, finding that original Twitter data still clustered only in the affected areas of the Atlantic coast in spite of false narratives about risk of a westward track through Alabama.

Wang et al. (2016) conducted their study using the `tm` and `igraph` packages in `R 3.1.2`. It is unknown what GIS software was used for spatial analysis, however, the authors do give credit to ESRI, suggesting the use of ArcGIS. The replication study by Holler (2021) used R, including the `rtweet`, `rehydratoR`, `igraph`, `sf`, and `spdep` packages for analysis. This replication study (done in `R 1.4.1103`) uses the same packages and code as Holler (2021) with the use of different data along with certain modifications in the code.

## Materials and Procedure

This analysis began by searching the Twitter database using the keywords 'tornado' and 'storm' within 300 miles of Jackson, Mississippi (32, -90). The time frame used for this analysis was April 29th, 2021 to May 5th, 2021. This search rendered a dataframe of 20296 observations. [Here](data/raw/public/Misstornadoids.txt) are the status_ids that can be used to recover the original tweets. A control or baseline (limited with the same number of observations as the tornado data) search without any keywords was also conducted, rendering 35998 observations whose status_id's can be found [here](data/raw/public/Missbaselineids.txt). Retweets were excluded from both searches in order to attain a more concentrated set of tweets. After filtering the data for tweets only within the designated place_type's of city, neighbourhood, and poi and with coordinates, the observations for the tornado tweets were 1480 while the baseline tweets were 2255.

This analysis also later normalized the tweet data using county-level population data from the U.S. Census Bureau in order to attain the tweet rate per 1000 population. The counties that were used in this analysis were from states including Mississippi and any bordering states as well: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. [Here](data/derived/public/Surround_counties.RDS) is a link to the census data with the selected states.

Below is a workflow of the methodology used for this analysis. The code behind this can be found [here](assets/my_search.R).(Thanks to Vincent's blog for inspiration and some of the details on this)
1. Tweets using keywords and baseline tweets were filtered for based on place_type and presence of geo-coordinates
2. A temporal analysis of tornado tweets by hour for the time period of seven days was conducted using the package 'rtweet'
3. A textual analysis of the tornado tweets was conducted by filtering the tweet content for stop words (using the existing R stop_words documentation) and graphing the frequency of the top 15 words present in all the tweet content
4. A second textual analysis was conducted by identifying word pairs in the tornado tweet content and presenting this in a word cloud using the 'ggraph' package
5. Spatial analysis involved acquiring census population data and geometry ([U.S. Census](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)) of selected states and plotting a choropleth map showing population density by county layered with tweet point data using the 'ggplot2' package
6. Tweets were grouped by county and summarised for the number of tweets. Tweet rates per 10,000 in population were calculated as well as the "Normalized Tweet Difference," using the formula (tornado - base)/(tornado + base)
7. Tornado tweets and baseline tweets were transformed into point data and the CRS NAD 1983 (4269) and were joined to county data by GEOID (This code was developed by [Casey Lilley (2019)](https://caseylilley.github.io/finalproj.html)] and edited by Holler (2021))
8. Data was then grouped by county and identified for which counties were within 110 kilometers of one another. A weight matrix was then created from these nearest neighbour objects
9. The Getis-Ord G* statistic was used to identify hot and cold spots of twitter data
10. G* scores were classified by their significance values at the p<0.125 and p<0.05 two-tailed confidence levels. These hot and cold spots were then mapped

## Unplanned Deviations from the Protocol

The analysis did not include any significant changes from the code and methodology produced by Holler (2021). Minor changes were made in the number of baseline tweets that were pulled from Twitter, which were based on the number of tornado tweets obtained. The word pairs network also used a lower count of 12 instead of 30 to graph the word cloud, according to the smaller set of data obtained. Certain map parameters were adjusted for better visualization and clearer labelling of graphs, and a map showing the "Normalized Tweet Difference" was also created. The Euclidean distance was changed from 110 km (Holler, 2021) to 50 km in order to adjust to the the geography of a tornado, which is much more narrow and covers a significantly smaller breadth than the geography of a hurricane, for which this methodology was developed. This distance was chosen as it was deemed to be an appropriate distance from the center of a given country to reach any of its adjacent counties, as part of the "nearest neighbour" analysis. This change largely influences the construction of the spatial weight matrix, and therefore, the hot spot analysis visualized in Figure 5.


## Additions to the Protocol

Bot data was analysed using the following code and included in Figure 4 to better visualise twitter activity:

```r
tornado <- tornado %>%
  mutate(bots = ifelse(source %in% c("Twitter for iPhone", "Twitter for Android", "Instagram", "Tweetbot for IOS"),
                       "not a bot",
                       "bot"))
```

## Discussion

Similar to the findings of Wang et al. (2016), the observed twitter activity surrouding tornados largely corresponded with the eastward movement of tornado activity from the period of April 29th to May 5th. Figure 1 shows peaks of tornado-related twitter activity on April 29th and from May 3rd to May 5th. The data that was obtained was concentrated in Mississippi with tweets from surrounding states included in the 300 miles stemming from Jackson, MI. The 29th of May showed tornado activity present in Texas and not Mississippi, and therefore, peaks in tornado-related tweets would have been from areas of Texas that fell within the mile radius, such as Dallas, TX. However, during the period of May 3rd to May 5th, tornado activity peaked for many of the Southern belt of states, including Mississippi, (Figure 7) explaining the trends in Figure 1 during this time period. Figure 6 also shows a clear focus on tornado-related witter activity, compared to baseline twitter activity, around the Mississippi area and parts of Texas from a normal level. This indicates people were utilizing twitter more than usual to reach out to others and spread word on the tornado occurrence.

The analysis of unique words found that the most number of words used by tweets in the area involved the use of 'ms', indicating the state, as well as 'warning', 'cdt' (Central Daylight Time), and 'pm'. All of these words indicate the use of warning messages and alerts that were spread to inform people on the weather status and where and when tornados would be affecting the area. A majority of the tweets that were issued during this time period were bot-created tweets by weather channels or the National Weather Service (Figure 4). Similar to the findings of Wang et al. (2016), these local news media accounts tend to dominate the twitter network during a disaster and are highly influential in the spread of information, at times preventing smaller occurrences and personal experiences to come to the fore. Although this reproduction did not involve the use of retweets, the data still indicates the influential role they played and the extent to which they dominate overall tweet content. Crawford and Finn (2014) point out the importance of looking into the presence of bots in data as this is something that is often not considered in Twitter analyses dealing with crises. This presence of "bot-culture" among Twitter activity makes it difficult to parse out human messages from the data, adding to epistemological limitations and uncertainties in these kinds of analyses, which must be acknowledged and further investigated for their influence on results. Bot tweets were largely concentrated in Mississippi, where tornados continuously occurred during this time period, possibly indicating a delayed response from people during the disaster. It also seems like the non-bot tweets are more concentrated in specific cities that were hit with tornado activity. This large presence in the data may speak to the inability of people to access online platforms simply due to the nature of a disaster occurring or due to the fact that there may be power outages and infrastructural damage in some of the more rural areas. These factors introduce uncertainty in the transformation of real-world phenomenon into data that can be analysed.

Figure 3 demonstrates similar findings to Figure 2, indicating the times at which the tornados were to occur, which was mostly likely information that was distributed by weather channels. The word pairings also reveal some of the counties and cities in Mississippi that were largely affected by the tornados: Calhoun (Vardaman - 43 homes affected), Yazoo (76 homes affected), and Lee counties (Tupelo and Saltillo - 76 homes affected) (As recorded by [WJTV](https://www.wjtv.com/news/local-news/18-tornadoes-confirmed-in-mississippi-for-may-2-may-4-severe-weather-events/#:~:text=Gaming%20%26%20Pop%20Culture-,18%20tornadoes%20confirmed%20in%20Mississippi%20for%20May,May%204%20severe%20weather%20events&text=At%20this%20time%2C%20no%20fatalities,homes%20affected%3B%206%20businesses%20affected)). The graph also involves the towns of Fort Worth and Blum in Texas, which would have been included in the 300 mile radius from Jackson, MI.

Figure 5 demonstrates these hotspots of activity. As mentioned before, the Euclidean distance used in the methodology was adjusted to 50 km, narrowing the scope of influence of twitter activity in one county on any of its surrounding counties. This resulted in hot spots of twitter activity that were more concentrated than what resulted from using 110 km as the geodesic distance. These hot spots also seem to better reflect the trajectory of tornado activity in Mississippi (Figure 7). This change demonstrates how studies must be adjusted and customized to the geographies of different natural hazards in order to more accurately understand their influence and impact. There are also many other options for better visualizing hot spots of Twitter activity. Wang et al. (2016) utilized Dual KDE to map the spatial patterns of these tweets along a gradient of low to high ignition locations of wildfires. Exploring how different methods of visualizing hot spots can be achieved in r and with r packages may result in a better visualization and interpretation of the data. Finally, Figure 6 demonstrates a similar trajectory of twitter activity in Mississippi (as well as parts of Texas) following the eastward movement of the tornado where tornado-related tweets were visibly dominant among twitter activity.

## Conclusion

Findings from this reproduction are consistent with Wang et al. (2016) and Holler (2021) in that they demonstrate how twitter activity tends to largely correspond with and track real-world disaster phenomenon. However, error and uncertainty present themselves at many scales. Much of the twitter data itself is not associated with geo-coordinates and would have to be extracted from the tweet content, similar to what Wang et al. (2016) did to identify specific wildfires in certain cities. Further looking into the influence of bots, local media, and weather channels would help to parse out information gleaned from twitter content and identify the specific roles these services play during a disaster, more specifically a weather-related disaster. Ultimately, Twitter data is useful to analyse in order to understand how people respond to disasters in real-time. It provides us with information on the specific experiences of people present in, and even outside, the spatial context of the disaster. Developing more robust analyses that look into this data will help us study human behavioural responses to diaster-related events.
