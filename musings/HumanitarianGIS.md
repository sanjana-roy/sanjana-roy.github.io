**This is a reflection on the reading of Crawford and Finn (2014) for Friday, April 30th.**

Consider the Crawford & Finn (2014) article and any of the crowd-sourced / volunteered geographic information (VGI) you have already worked with personally (e.g. Twitter, OpenStreetMap) in relation to Longley et al’s framework of uncertainty filters in the process of geographic research.

* What types of uncertainty are most prevalent in the use of VGI for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
* Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
* Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?

When gathering data from VGI sources, the first thing that comes to mind is who are the people that are using these platforms and that have the power to influence the information and data that is projected on these platforms? Uncertainty arises in the validity and representation of the data that is collected from these sources. For example, who are the people that have access to Twitter or other social media accounts during a crisis or disaster? Power outages and lack of technological infrastructure would influence how people and who are the people that use these platforms. There are many cases where VGI platforms are only known to more educated populations and therefore, much of the information being put out there must be critiqued through this lens. For example, who are the people that contribute to open mapping platforms and what information could they be missing out on unknowingly?  Furthermore, internet platforms often tend to attract younger populations of people, often of an urban demographic, creating yet another wider issue of representation in using this data to research disasters and humanitarian crises (Crawford and Finn, 2014).

As Crawford and Finn (2014) point out, bots are also a common occurrence on social media platforms that are often not taken into account in research. These accounts may skew the data in a certain direction, creating uncertainties in the truth of information being accessed and whether this is a representation of real-world processes. As Wang et al. (2016) mention through their research, “opinion leaders” on social media have a large influence on the “retweet network,” and in general, the dispersion of information on social media platforms. They may, again, work to push information in a certain direction, leading to real-time accounts being hidden or certain “sensational stories” magnified. This kind of representation and influence by different accounts on specifically social media platforms create a lot of uncertainty in the data.

Researchers, therefore, have an ethical obligation to understand who is contributing to the data. Through Longley et al.’s (2005) uncertainty framework, this real-world issue may translate to a skewed analysis of the information. Without acknowledging this large influence on information, research outcomes, and perhaps, policy outcomes, may only apply to specific populations or not present a holistic picture of the crisis at hand. Crawford and Finn (2014) also point out that a focus on the long-term context leading up to a disaster is often ignored with a focus on data in a particular time frame, leading to an incomplete understanding of the full scope of an event. Many of the uncertainties in using VGIs for research on disasters arise from data representation of the real world onto these platforms.

There are also many ethical concerns that further complicate uncertainty. In a world of data and technology where there are limited regulations, or many loop-holes, regarding the privacy of users on online platforms, the use of this form of data must be assessed through an ethical lens. Big tech companies have consistently proven that they cannot be trusted and have demonstrated that they capitalise on their users’ innocence and ignorance of their agency regarding their personal information. Through our class discussion, I understood that Twitter doesn’t really hold researchers accountable to its data use policies or enforce it in any active way. When it comes to a crisis, Crawford and Finn (2014) explain how people don’t necessarily think about the consequences of posting information online and how that will be used in an already-vulnerable situation where they are trying to reach out for help. This question of consent in using this data speaks to larger issues in how these platforms operate. Scientific research has ethical obligations in recognising and critiquing the choices of these platforms. In using their information without this acknowledgement, researchers further add to the black hole of data rights issues that we face today.

Although VGIs can be a useful source of data to gather information from, its use must be thoroughly critiqued, especially with regards to the translation of real-world phenomenon and processes onto these virtual platforms as well as the ethical issues behind people’s contributions to data sources.
