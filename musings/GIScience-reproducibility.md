title: GIS as Reproducible Science
---

**This is a reflection on readings regarding GIScience and Reproducibility for Wednesday, March 10th.**

* Which category of “GIS as Science” most applies to the work you have done so far in this course or other courses using GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as “science”?
* How can open source GIS contribute to solving problems of the reproducibility crisis?


After having taken GEOG 120 (Human Geography with GIS), I was of the opinion that I had been able to learn a new and powerful tool that would be of great use in questions of spatial analysis. Throughout the course, I was given data to analyze and plug into GIS software, creating an algorithm that led to an outcome, which in turn would be recontextualized to formulate an answer to the original question. My understanding of GIS was its ability to generate an outcome, such as a visualization, based on a set of steps that it was fed. I had never considered its place within science but understood that it may fall under the wider STEM field, seemingly more akin to the field of statistics. I view science as knowledge system that uses a particular set of methods to add to a knowledge base. Science begins with a question, leading to a hypothesis, developing a methodology, conducting observations, and finally, evaluating the process and the outcomes. Theories that we learned were based off of scientific research and evaluation and employed in this software.

However, looking back at the process we employed through our GEOG 120 projects, each followed a similar trajectory of the scientific method. Our methodology was formed using tools and models as part of GIS. Our results were also evaluated based on the constraints of our methodology and the assumptions, ethics, and uncertainty in our process. In this sense, we were “doing science.” As mentioned in an excerpt from the GIS-L discussion in Wright et al. (1997), “every time one applies these data modelling rules, one is testing the hypothesis that is fits reality.” Another excerpt says, “GIS theory is science assuming that the development of algorithms, proper methodology, is science.” Although one can distinguish between GIS theory and its applicability in forming GIS software, I do now think that the very nature of using the software forces one to employ scientific thinking in developing an algorithm or methodology.

The National Academy of Sciences asks the following questions regarding the reproducibility of research:
1.	Are the data and analysis laid out with sufficient transparency and clarity that the results can be checked?
2.	If checked, do the data and analysis offered in support of the result in fact support that result?

In science, as well as in many other disciplines, methodologies behind research are detailed in a narrative format as part of a research paper. This allows research to be replicable, i.e. using the methods and applying it to another context. However, in order to be reproducible, data, instruments, and other specifications need to be available to a researcher looking to check these results. Unless raw data is openly available to researchers, and specific tools accessible, then reproducibility of research becomes an issue. Open source GIS, as we have learnt, allows for a platform where not only the tools behind the research are made available to people, but also the code behind these programs and the ability to freely use, distribute, and modify them. This platform also lends research to be instantaneously accessible without going through formalized processes for acquiring information. Data can also be made freely available in this manner and many geodatabases are public. The transparency of the open source community and the encoding of methods, allowing for easier reuse, gives open source GIS much potential for streamlined reproducibility.
