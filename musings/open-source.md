title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---

**This is a reflection on readings regarding Open Source GIScience for Friday, February 26th.**

The Open-source software community is considered an “innovation” or “gift” community as it provides access to not only the software tools but also the code behind the technology and the freedom to experiment with and distribute it. As Rey (2009) and Singleton et al. (2015) mention, there are numerous benefits of Open-Source software to both students and wider academia over simply free software: the ability to understand and assess the software code, to identify errors and limitations in algorithms in the context of specific research efforts, to further develop the software for new research purposes. By its very nature of open access, this kind of software encourages learning and innovation. Therefore, the role of Open-Source software at academic institutions, and more specifically, at an undergraduate liberal arts college, in contrast to proprietary software, forms a unique place in the learning opportunities it offers students.

Much of academia works with material and subject matter that is relatively static compared to the fast-paced and dynamic world of technology and software. Studying Open-Source software gives us the ability to parallel this pace and take part in something that is constantly evolving while being collaborative and open to feedback and criticism. This kind of model comes with new implications for course and grading structures at the college level.

In a world where hierarchies exist in both academic environments, it becomes difficult to do away with structures that support and conform to this system. As Rey (2009) mentions, traditional academic reward structures tend to undervalue the collaborative community structure of Open-Source software, contributing to brain drain in this field. This collaborative component seems central to the learning the Open-Source community as it would be in our classroom as well and therefore, we should do our best to encourage this model with an assessment system that follows accordingly. Recognition in the classroom could be assessed by the quality of critique, contribution, or use in further development of peers’ work. As for the honor code, which states that “unauthorized aid” is not permitted for use in an assignment, this would still be applicable as we read through our peers’ work. In a collaborative environment, however, this kind of “aid” would technically be “authorized.” Nevertheless, attribution should still be given to specific ideas found in peer work, which may have inspired other ideas or led to their further development, keeping the spirit of the honor code and academic integrity in mind. In creating a space for Open-Source learning at this level, we would be supporting its adoption and recognition for research and further study at a wider academic level.
