title: Error and Uncertainty
---

**This is a reflection on readings regarding GIScience and Reproducibility for Friday, March 12th.**

* Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
* What responsibilities do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
* What strategies might geographers use to fulfil those responsibilities?


Longley et al. (2008) defines uncertainty as a “measure of the user’s understanding of the difference between the contents of a dataset, and the real phenomenon that the data are believed to represent.” In transforming real world phenomenon to objective data, and in attempting to conceptualise and measure it, there is much that is lost in translation and many assumptions underlying the represented data. Uncertainty, therefore, becomes an inevitable part of any geographic data or representation and has been reflected on as part of most GIS projects I have done in the past.

Although I have not worked on calculating uncertainty in any of the projects I have done, uncertainty in data is something I was encouraged to reflect on and be aware of when analysing my results. A key takeaway from our final exam project in GEOG 120, exploring flood hazard vulnerability to Vermont’s mobile homes, was to identify trends in the distribution of mobile homes in order to accurately assess what technique to determine flood risk is most suitable. Using area-weighted reaggregation with total data of mobile homes in a county to assess flood risk assumed an even distribution of mobile homes throughout the area and was therefore, the wrong analysis to be using in this scenario. This was an example of a question of whether we were using an appropriate process of analysis for the respective data. Other instances have involved understanding the data itself. There may be vagueness or ambiguity in how data is labelled or categorized. For example, the boundaries ecological regions, such as riparian zones, are disputable and may change according to how they are determined: length from the river, moisture in the soil, etc. What counts as a hospital in a dataset my also not be clear. Does a hospital have a certain number of beds and facilities to be labelled as a “hospital” or can a “hospital” also be a clinic (thanks to Steven for this example).

I think the most important aspect of conducting spatial research is to understand the uncertainty you are working with and how many uncertainties compounded together can impact the outcomes of an analysis. As we had discussed in class, uncertainty can arise at many points in the process of spatial research, from how data is categorized, how a problem is framed, errors in measurement, representation, in motion, etc. Being cognisant and critical of how uncertainty and assumptions arise at each of these levels is crucial to successful and sound research. Using high quality data sources as well as relying on multiple sources of data (Longley et al., 2008) is one way to approach the issue of uncertainty at the base level. While reporting results or making representations of your work public, I think it is important to list some of the main uncertainties that were present through the analysis. This is an issue that comes up with maps a lot. As powerful methods of visualization, maps have the ability to convey a strong message and influence someone’s understanding of data. However, there are always uncertainties underlying the making and representation in a map. This is especially dangerous when they are quickly distributed in the visual culture we have today. Being transparent about communicating these uncertainties in a way that stays with the map as it is distributed could be a strategy for geographers to fulfil their responsibilities of conducting spatial research.
