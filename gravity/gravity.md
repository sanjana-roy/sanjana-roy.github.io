### [The Gravity Model](assets/GravityModel.model3)

The Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction is a tool used to predict the amount of interaction between two places. The model estimates catchment areas for any given service point using "weights" or "attractiveness" of input and target layers and a distance matrix. Centroids of the input polygon are created and put into a distance matrix along with target features. The distance matrix by default evaluates interaction with 20 of the nearest target features, however, this 'k value' can be adjusted under advanced settings. Input and target weights are joined and the potential for interaction is calculated. The parameters of friction of distance (alpha), input weight or emissivity (beta), and target weight or attractiveness (lambda) are advanced settings to allow full implementation and adjustment of the gravity model formula as found in Rodrigue's ["The Geography of Transport Systems"](https://transportgeography.org/contents/methods/spatial-interactions-gravity-model/):
>(inputWeight)^λ * (targetWeight)^α / (distance)^β

The maximum potential of each input feature in relation to a target feature is extracted for and input features are aggregated and dissolved according to the spatial reach of each target feature.

### [Target Features Preprocessing Model](assets/TargetFeaturesPreprocessing2.model3)

This model is to be used in preparation for the Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction. In many cases, target features may need to be aggregated due to their proximity to one another. It often makes most sense to aggregate them by the same spatial units used for the input features in the Gravity Model. Target features are dissolved according to the input features they share in common and centroids are created for the respective groups.

### [Homeland Security Processing Model](assets/HomelandSecurityPreprocessing.model3)

This model is used to specifically process Homeland Security Hospital data for use as an input polygon layer in the Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction. Data is cleaned according to the following criteria:
1. Hospitals that only have normal intensive care units for public use (removing psychiatric and military hospitals)
2. Hospitals with missing data on the number of beds are excluded
3. Hospitals that are closed are excluded

### Implementation

In this example, the gravity model is used to estimate catchment areas for hospital emergency rooms and I.C.U. services by towns in the state of Connecticut. A Connecticut polygon layer (with fixed geometries) was used to clip New England towns with stored population data and town names (Thanks Maddie for this idea). Homeland hospital data was passed through the Homeland Security Processing and the Target Features Preprocessing Model. Towns served as the input features with town names and populations as respective unique identification fields and weight fields while hospitals served as the target features with hospital name and number of beds as the same respective fields. Advanced parameters were left at default settings.

In order to compare the data generated through this model, [Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Hospital Services Areas (HSAs)](https://atlasdata.dartmouth.edu/downloads/supplemental#boundaries) are provided, where catchments are organized by zip code tabulation areas based on databases of patients using medicare and medicaid.


### Interpretation of Model Results with the Dartmouth Atlas HSAs

[**Link to Map of Hospital Catchments in Connecticut**](assets/)

Hospital catchments generated from the Gravity Model above generally align with those of the Dartmouth Atlas HSAs, however, the HSAs seem to cover smaller areas and serve smaller population sizes. Certain catchment areas generated by my model cover large swathes of the Connecticut state that appear to very distant from the hospital itself. The analysis done by this model can be further enhanced by specifying parameters of alpha, beta, and lambda. As our analysis is done with an objective population number in relation to the number of beds at hospitals, the catchments generated are also generalized to the wider population. However, the Dartmouth Atlas data utilizes a database of patients using medicare and medicaid, which narrows down the catchment sizes according to more specific population data in relation to healthcare, which perhaps makes this analysis more accurate.
